# LinkedIn Post Creation Rules for Marcos Heidemann

## üö´ **NEVER DO:**

### 1. Role-Based Opening Lines
- ‚ùå "As a Principal [anything]..."
- ‚ùå "As someone working in [industry]..."
- ‚ùå "In my role as [title]..."
- ‚ùå "Being a [profession]..."

**Why:** These openings are clich√© and don't reflect authentic personal voice.

### 2. Statistics Without Sources
- ‚ùå Any statistic, percentage, or data point without a valid URL source
- ‚ùå Vague attributions like "recent study shows" or "experts say"
- ‚ùå Unverifiable claims presented as facts

**Why:** Credibility is paramount for technical professionals.

## ‚úÖ **MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:**

### 1. Source Attribution for ALL Statistics
- **Format:** Every statistic MUST include a valid, clickable URL
- **Placement:** Include sources either inline or at the end of the post
- **Verification:** Sources must be verifiable and current
- **Example:** 
  ```
  42% of executives say GenAI is "tearing their company apart" 
  (Source: https://example.com/actual-study-link)
  ```

### 2. Authentic Opening Styles
Instead of role-based openings, use:
- **Direct insight:** "Here's what caught my attention about..."
- **Observation:** "Something interesting happened in the AI space..."
