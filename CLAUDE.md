# LinkedIn Post Creation Workflow

This document outlines the exact workflow for creating high-quality LinkedIn posts based on Marcos Heidemann's preferences and successful posting patterns.

## üìã **Complete Workflow Steps**

### 1. **Date/Time Check (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)**
```bash
date
```
**Purpose**: Get accurate current date/time for research context
**Why**: Ensures research is current and relevant

### 2. **Research Phase**
Use the research-documentation-specialist agent:
```
Task: Research latest [TOPIC] news from [CURRENT_DATE]. Focus on:
- Recent developments and breakthroughs  
- Technical advances with specific metrics
- Business/industry impact with statistics
- Emerging trends relevant to ML/DS engineers
```

### 3. **Source Verification (CRITICAL)**
After initial research, ALWAYS verify sources:
```
Task: Find and verify actual URLs for these specific claims:
[LIST EACH STATISTIC/CLAIM]

For each claim, I need:
- Exact, accessible URL (not paywalled)
- Verification the link works and contains specific data
- If paywalled, find alternative accessible sources
- Confirm publication date

Provide only verified, clickable URLs. If cannot verify, clearly state which claims lack sources.
```

### 4. **Content Creation**
Follow these rules:

#### ‚ùå **NEVER DO:**
- Start with "As a Principal..." or any role-based opening
- Include statistics without verified source URLs
- Use generic professional introductions

#### ‚úÖ **ALWAYS DO:**
- Start with direct insight, observation, or intriguing statement
- Include only verified statistics with working URLs
- Provide sources section with numbered list
- Ask specific questions targeting ML/DS professionals

#### **Post Structure:**
```
Hook (1 line)
‚Üì
Context/Development (2-3 sentences)
‚Üì  
Analysis/Perspective (2-4 bullet points)
‚Üì
Engagement Question (1-2 sentences)
‚Üì
Sources (mandatory)
‚Üì
Hashtags (5-7 maximum)
```

### 5. **Source Attribution Format**
```
Sources:
‚Ä¢ [Description]: [URL]
‚Ä¢ [Description]: [URL]
‚Ä¢ [Description]: [URL]
```

### 6. **Quality Control Checklist**
Before posting, verify:
- [ ] No role-based opening ("As a...")
- [ ] All statistics have valid source URLs
- [ ] Sources are accessible and current
- [ ] Authentic voice and genuine insights
- [ ] Specific engagement question for ML/DS professionals
- [ ] 5-7 relevant hashtags
- [ ] 600-1000 character target met
- [ ] Technical accuracy verified

### 7. **Post Execution**
Create JavaScript file and execute:
```bash
cd ~/Documents/dev/linkedin-optimizer-mcp
node post-to-linkedin.js
```

## üéØ **Content Guidelines**

### **Preferred Opening Styles:**
- "The gap between [X] and [Y] just got clearer..."
- "Here's what caught my attention about..."
- "Something interesting happened in..."
- "The latest developments reveal..."
- "While everyone's celebrating [X], we're missing..."

### **Core Hashtags (Always Include):**
- `#MachineLearning`
- `#ArtificialIntelligence` 
- `#MLOps`

### **Contextual Hashtags (Choose 2-4):**
- `#TechLeadership` (strategy/management)
- `#GenAI` (generative AI)
- `#DataScience` (data-focused)
- `#Innovation` (research/breakthroughs)
- `#TechTrends` (industry analysis)

### **Engagement Questions That Work:**
- "What patterns are you seeing in [specific area]?"
- "How are you handling [specific challenge]?"
- "What's been your experience with [technology/approach]?"
- "Are companies that [approach A] seeing better results than [approach B]?"

## üìä **Success Metrics Example**

### Recent Successful Post:
